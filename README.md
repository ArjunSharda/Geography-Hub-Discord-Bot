Geography Hub Discord Bot
-------------------------
Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered discord bot


This is Geography Hub's Discord Bot, that i've made for active implementation in the [Geography Hub](https://discord.gg/Vu5QTNCwEP) discord server, a server for people who share like-minded interests in Geography and want to talk to like-minded people. This is a artificial-intelligence powered discord bot that I have made on November 23, 2023, available to the open source community under the MIT license. Feel free to contribute via PRs!




Breakdown of Code
-----------------

The discord bot is made in Python using nextcord V2. The discord bot includes options to ban, kick, and manually warn members of your community, with fun commands like 8ball, member count, and more. This bot also has a verification system with select menus and comprehensive button support. You may use the code of the bot under the MIT license for personal or commercial use.



Actively Maintained
-------------------

This project is actively maintained as of November 23, 2023, until further notice. Pull requests are accepted, as well as any bugs.
